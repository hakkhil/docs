## How to add the AI agent to your website?
To integrate the AI agent into your website, you can use our easy-to-install widget:

### Website Widget

This method allows you to embed a sleek and modern chat bubble in the corner of your website. The widget remains visible and easily accessible, providing a consistent experience. When a user clicks it, a floating chat window opens, allowing them to type or speak with your AI agent without leaving the current page. The widget is designed to be unobtrusive while offering a seamless and convenient way for users to get the help they need, the moment they need it.

### Connect to Phone Lines

You can also connect your AI agent to a phone number via our Twilio integration. This enables your customers to call in and have a natural conversation with your AI voice agent, receiving support or information just as they would from a human agent.

We are continuously expanding our integration options, with a software development kit (SDK) and more methods coming soon to give you even greater flexibility in deploying your AI agents.
