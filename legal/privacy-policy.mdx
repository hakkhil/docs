  9. If you are dissatisfied with our response, you may lodge a complaint with your local data protection authority or supervisory body, such as the European Data Protection Board, the UK's ICO, or the relevant state authority in your jurisdiction.

**11. EXERCISING YOUR RIGHTS**
  1. You may exercise your data protection rights under this Privacy Policy by submitting a written request to us at support@intervo.ai. We are committed to facilitating your rights in a timely, transparent, and legally compliant manner, in accordance with applicable data protection laws including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the California Consumer Privacy Rights Act (CPRA), the Indian Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), and other relevant frameworks.
  2. To help us process your request effectively, please include sufficient details to verify your identity and describe the nature of your request. Depending on the type of request and the applicable legal jurisdiction, we may request additional information for verification, particularly where sensitive or high-risk data is involved. Requests that cannot be verified, are repetitive or manifestly unfounded, or conflict with the rights of others may be lawfully denied, in which case we will provide a clear explanation.
  3. Upon successful verification, we will take appropriate action in accordance with applicable legal timelines. For example, GDPR requires a response within one month of receipt of the request, while CPRA provides a 45-day timeline.

  6. Access to your personal data is restricted to only those personnel, contractors, or authorized partners who require such access to provide our services, and all such parties are subject to confidentiality and data processing agreements.
  7. Where data is transmitted to sub processors or third-party tools, we ensure that those vendors meet the security and privacy obligations required under applicable laws and our own internal policies.
  8. Despite our efforts, no system is completely immune to risks, and we cannot guarantee absolute security. In the unlikely event of a data breach involving your personal data, we will notify you and the appropriate regulatory authorities in accordance with our legal obligations and within legally prescribed timeframes.
  9. If you have reason to believe that your interaction with Intervo.ai is no longer secure or you suspect unauthorized activity involving your account, please notify us immediately at support@intervo.ai so we can investigate and take appropriate measures.

**13. AI AND AUTOMATED PROCESSING DISCLOSURE**
  1. Intervo.ai is designed as an advanced conversational Al platform that leverages artificial intelligence, including large language models (LLMs), to enable automated voice and chat interactions. As part of its core functionality, Intervo.ai uses AI technologies to understand user inputs, generate responses, make recommendations, and facilitate customer engagement without human intervention. These systems may include automated workflows, intent recognition engines, natural language processing modules, and decision-making algorithms that help streamline user onboarding, support, lead qualification, and other communications.
  2. Where applicable, and in accordance with Article 22 of the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and other international legal frameworks such as the California Consumer Privacy Rights Act (CPRA) and India's Digital Personal Data Protection Act (DPDPA), we provide transparent notice that certain interactions with Intervo.ai may involve fully automated processing that produces legal or similarly significant effects. However, we do not subject users to decisions solely based on automated processing that have such effects unless we have obtained your explicit consent or such processing is otherwise authorized by law.
  3. The Al models used by Intervo.ai, including but not limited to integrations with OpenAI, Claude, Gemini, or other LLM providers, operate based on the input data provided by users and pre-configured workflows.
  4. Intervo.ai does not use your personal data to train generalized AI or machine learning models. Where Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) or private knowledge base features are used, your data remains under the control of the deploying party or system administrator.
  5. We maintain strict controls to limit access to data processed by Al components, including access logs, usage monitoring, and role-based restrictions. All automated systems are subject to rigorous testing, human oversight, and continuous improvement to ensure fairness, transparency, and alignment with applicable laws and ethical Al principles.
  6. If you have concerns about automated decisions or wish to contest or request human intervention in a decision made by the system, you may do so by contacting support@intervo.ai. We will respond to your request in accordance with applicable legal obligations.
