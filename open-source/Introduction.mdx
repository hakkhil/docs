## Intervo.ai - Open Source Edition

Welcome to the open-source version of Intervo.ai! This repository contains the core framework for building, deploying, and managing sophisticated AI voice and chat agents. We believe in democratizing access to powerful conversational AI, and by open-sourcing our core technology, we hope to empower developers and businesses to create innovative solutions.

This project is for you if you want to:
* Build a custom AI chat or voice agent with complete control over the code.
* Integrate conversational AI into your own applications and infrastructure.
* Contribute to a community-driven project shaping the future of human-computer interaction.
* Understand the inner workings of a production-grade conversational AI platform.

### Key Features

* **Dual Voice & Chat Channels:** A unified framework to handle both text-based conversations and real-time voice interactions.
* **Extensible Core:** A modular architecture that allows you to easily add new features, integrations, and capabilities.
* **Custom Knowledge Sources:** Train your agents on your own documents, websites, and APIs for accurate, context-aware responses.
* **Telephony Integration Hooks:** Includes the necessary components to connect your agents to telephony providers like Twilio for handling phone calls.
* **Full Data Control:** Self-host your agents and maintain complete ownership and privacy of your data and user interactions.
